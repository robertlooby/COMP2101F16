#   and how much disk space they use. It will also show the sizes
#   and names of the user-specified (default is 3) largest files in that directory.

### Variables definitions
declare -i numberOfFilesToShow # numberOfFilesToShow is the number of files to show
numberOfFilesToShow=3 # our default count of files to show is 3
declare -i filecount # this variable will hold our count of regular files
# default directory to work in is our Pictures directory in our home directory
directory=~/Pictures

### MAIN

## Process our command line
# allow directory to be specified and filecount to be specified
# only allow one directory name on the command line
